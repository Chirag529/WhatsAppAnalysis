## Exporting WhatsApp Chat

Before analyzing your WhatsApp chat, you need to export it from your smartphone. Follow these steps:

- If you are using an iPhone:
    1. Open the chat with the person or group you want to export.
    2. Tap on the Contact Name or the Group Name at the top of the chat.
    3. Scroll to the bottom and tap on "Export Chat."

- If you are using an Android smartphone:
    1. Open the chat with the person or group you want to export.
    2. Tap on the three dots (menu) located at the top right corner of the chat.
    3. Select "More" or "Options."
    4. Tap on "Export Chat."

- Regardless of your smartphone type, you'll be prompted to choose whether you want to export the chat with or without media (images, videos, etc.). For simplicity in your analysis, you can choose "without media."

- After making your selection, you'll have the option to email this chat to yourself. Enter your email address and send the chat.

- Access your email from your computer, open the email containing the exported chat, and download it to your system.
